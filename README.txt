RSFPDF is a fork of 'RPDF', a public domain PDF library for Real Studio / Real Basic.

Like RPDF, RSPDF is a port of the php PDF library, fpdf (http://www.fpdf.org).  However it appears that RPDF has been abandoned with the last release made in March 2008.  RSPDF is an effort to pickup where its predecessor left off.  It will be maintained and updated for more recent versions of Real Studio.

The license will remain the same as RPDF and FPDF.  RSPDF (as was RPDF) is FREEWARE like FPDF (the project where this class is based on).There is no use limitations. It can be used in free or commercial applications, with/out modifications.My immediate To Do List:
